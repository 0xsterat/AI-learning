# Understanding User Prompts vs System Prompts

## What is a User Prompt?

A user prompt is the direct instruction or question you send to the AI model. It's what the end user asks for.

## What is a System Prompt?
A system prompt (or system instruction) is a hidden instruction that sets the behavior, tone, and role of the AI. It shapes how the AI responds to user prompts.

## Key Takeaways
| Aspect | User Prompt | System Prompt |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| What is it? | The direct question/instruction from the user | Hidden instruction that defines AI  |
| Who writes it? | End user / Application user | Developer / Application designer |
| Purpose | Asks for specific information or task | Sets the tone, role, and constraints |
| Visibility | Visible to the user	| Usually hidden from the end user | 
| Example	| "Write a story about a robot"	| "You are a creative fiction writer" | 
| Impact	| Determines WHAT the AI should do | Determines HOW the AI should respond | 

### Remember: 
The same user prompt can produce completely different outputs depending on the system prompt!
